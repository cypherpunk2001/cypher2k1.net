[0x0F] CORE LOOPS

        "there is no endgame.
         there is only maintenance."


 salvage feeds fabrication.
 extraction feeds weaponry.

 scavenging finds calories.
 cooking makes them safe.

 projectiles consume preparation.
 melee consumes proximity.

 anomaly consumes stability.

 all loops converge on one rule:

 survive without manuals.


 THE SURVIVAL LOOP
     scavenge → cook → eat → heal
     this never stops
     ignore it and you weaken
     master it and you outlast

 THE GEAR LOOP
     salvage → fabricate → equip → fight
     extraction → refine → upgrade → dominate
     better gear requires better materials
     better materials require deeper risks

 THE ECONOMY LOOP
     gather → craft → trade → accumulate
     reputation gates access
     monopolies form at chokepoints
     break them or become them

 THE POWER LOOP
     harvest corruption → refine → channel anomaly
     the nullsect guards this knowledge
     high risk, high reward, high visibility
     the world watches anomaly users

 THE PVP LOOP
     survive → gear up → enter wilderness → fight
     win: loot their body
     lose: they loot yours
     the wilderness takes everything
     and remembers nothing


 there is no final boss.
 there is no credits screen.
 there is only the next loop,
 and the one after that,
 and the choice to keep going
 when stopping is always an option.
