        "hunger doesn't negotiate.
         neither should you."


 scavenging does not provide food.

 scavenging provides:
     biomass
     protein
     things that were alive recently

 water is compromised.
 ecosystems adapted badly.
 nothing comes out clean.

 what you pull up is calories,
 not permission.

 eat it raw if you want.
 the system will remember.


 scavenge sources:

 DRAINAGE POOLS
     mutated fish, edible fungi, algae mats
     low risk, low quality
     starter zones, reliable but weak

 INDUSTRIAL RUNOFF
     larger catches, contamination risk
     better protein, worse side effects
     cooking becomes mandatory

 WILDERNESS WATERWAYS
     pre-collapse species, some intact
     best yields, dangerous territory
     other scavengers compete violently

 UNDERCITY RESERVOIRS
     forgotten stockpiles, sealed tanks
     rare finds, expedition required
     what you find might find you first


 higher scavenging skill:
     faster catches, better identification
     ability to spot contamination before consumption
     access to deeper, richer sources

 the wasteland provides.
 the wasteland does not explain
 what you're eating.
