[0x0E] ANOMALY   ( M A G I C )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "the rules have holes.
         some of us learned to fit through."


 magic is not supernatural.
 it is the world misbehaving.

 anomalies occur where:
     systems overlap
     time desyncs
     rules stop updating

 magic users are tolerated,
 never trusted.

 every exploit widens the crack.


 anomaly requires fuel:
     corruption—harvested instability from fracture zones
     refined into glyphs, charges, implants
     the nullsect controls most supply lines
     independent harvesters don't last long

 anomaly effects:

 DISPLACEMENT
     short-range teleportation
     escape tool, ambush enabler
     costs corruption, leaves a signature

 DISRUPTION
     system interference, drone scrambling
     electronics fail in your radius
     makes you visible to other anomaly users

 DISTORTION
     damage at range, reality as weapon
     expensive, loud, undeniable
     the syndicate tracks every discharge

 DAMPENING
     defensive nullification
     incoming damage reduced
     incoming anomaly reflected
     the only polite use of the skill


 the more anomaly you use,
 the more the world notices you.

 corruption attracts corruption.
 eventually something answers.
