        "every bullet is a confession.
         every miss is evidence."


 ranged combat is preparation.

 every shot represents:
     scavenged material
     fabricated intent
     calculated distance

 miss and you lose resources.
 hit and you leave evidence.

 distance feels safe
 until it collapses.


 projectile weapons:

 IMPROVISED (slings, thrown scrap)
     low damage, cheap ammo, quiet
     good for pulling singles
     embarrassing but effective

 MECHANICAL (crossbows, pneumatic launchers)
     medium damage, reusable bolts
     no power required
     the rustborn standard

 BALLISTIC (firearms, salvaged and fabricated)
     high damage, loud, ammunition-hungry
     syndicate gear, expensive to maintain
     everyone hears, everyone investigates

 ENERGY (rare, pre-collapse tech)
     requires charged cells
     devastating but conspicuous
     marks you as someone worth robbing


 ammunition is the real cost.
 fabrication feeds the habit.
 extraction feeds fabrication.
 the loop never ends.

 ranged specialists don't run out of ammo.
 ranged specialists run out of targets
 before the ammo runs out.

 if you're counting shots,
 you already lost.
