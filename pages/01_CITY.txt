[0x01] THE CITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "every light is a question.
         every shadow knows the answer."


 the city never sleeps.
 not because it lives.
 because it is watched.

 neon is surveillance with better marketing.


 safe zones exist.
 safe means: no pvp, no theft, enforcers respond.
 safe does not mean: free.

 the city has layers:

 UPPER DISTRICT
     syndicate territory, corporate remnants
     clean streets, working lights, visible security
     everything costs more
     everyone reports everything

 MID DISTRICT
     neutral ground, market sprawl
     rustborn workshops, street vendors, information brokers
     reputation matters here
     violence is bad for business (usually)

 LOWER DISTRICT
     where the lights flicker
     nullsect corners, black markets, unlicensed clinics
     enforcers don't patrol
     anything can be bought if you know who to ask

 UNDERCITY
     maintenance tunnels, abandoned transit, buried infrastructure
     not officially part of the city
     no rules, no witnesses
     the city pretends it doesn't exist


 above ground: watched.
 below ground: forgotten.

 choose your altitude carefully.
