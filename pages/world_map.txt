[0x16] WORLD MAP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "the map is not the territory.
         but the territory was overwritten."


 five cities remain.
 one wasteland endures.
 the loop is the only path
 that doesn't lead to error.

===============================================================================
[BOOTYARD]   S T A R T E R   H U B
===============================================================================


        "everyone here is new.
         even the people who've been here ten years."


 where abandoned logistics became housing
 and never stopped being a logistics problem.

 container-stacked streets.
 cracked loading docks.
 a canal that still moves
 because the pumps outlasted the people.

 the air smells like wet cardboard,
 diesel, and cheap solvent.


 FUNCTION:
     onboarding zone
     basic scavenging spots
     cooking without contamination (mostly)
     early ignition (burn barrels, heat coils)
     starter quests

 NPCS:
     fixers
     dock clerks
     med vendors
     one tired archivist
     who keeps telling you
     not to trust clean-looking doors

 STORY HOOK:
     bootyard's "public terminal" is always on.
     it shouldn't be.
     every night at 02:01
     it prints a receipt-sized strip of text
     that doesn't match any job queue.

     people pin the strips to walls like prayers.

     one of them has your name on it.
     dated tomorrow.



===============================================================================
[KERNEL CITY]   C A P I T A L   /   M A R K E T
===============================================================================


        "the city behaves like a memory system.
         it opens for some and silently fails for others."


 the part of the world that still believes it's in charge.
 not because it's powerful,
 but because it has the most intact interfaces.

 buildings wrapped in signage like bandages.
 streets that loop slightly wrong,
 as if the navigation mesh was patched
 and never rebuilt.

 in the center: a plaza of terminals and glass.
 an economy of tokens, favors, cached permissions.
 loud. bright. relentlessly observed.


 FUNCTION:
     primary exchange (the plaza)
     secure storage / banking
     high-traffic multiplayer hub
     major questlines
     advanced fabrication access
     faction presence (KERNEL CITY faction)

 FACTION: KERNEL CITY
     bureaucrats, merchants, interface keepers
     they believe in process
     they believe in records
     they believe in you
     only if you're in the system

 STORY HOOK:
     a faction inside kernel city
     is rewriting reputations.
     not hacking them—
     re-recording them, like an old cassette.

     people who were infamous are "clean."
     people who never existed
     are suddenly on every list.

     the city doesn't correct it.
     it propagates it.



===============================================================================
[NULLGATE]   T H R E S H O L D   /   E D G E   T O W N
===============================================================================


        "the siren doesn't warn you about danger.
         it announces you."


 where the map stops being polite.
 the last serviced checkpoint.
 the last place where anyone pretends
 rules are universal.

 harsh lighting. utilitarian.
 streets wide enough for vehicles
 that no longer come.

 the locals are trainers, mercs,
 and people who lost something in the north
 and came back wrong.


 FUNCTION:
     combat training
     projectiles training
     wilderness preparation
     pvp-adjacent culture
     risk tutorials
     serious salvage (composite scraps, frame parts)
     last stop before nullzone

 ECONOMY:
     ammo
     blades
     batteries
     information

 STORY HOOK:
     nullgate's warning siren triggers randomly.
     no pattern. no storms. no incursions.

     old-timers swear it's not a malfunction.
     they say it's reacting to someone's name
     entering the wilderness level range.

     it doesn't warn you about danger.
     it announces you.



===============================================================================
[GARRISON]   A U T H O R I T Y   /   F O R T R E S S
===============================================================================


        "garrison is not safe.
         it's controlled. that's different."


 bright floodlights. clean angles.
 scanners that still work.
 people who speak in policies
 even when they're flirting.

 the streets are orderly
 because disorder is expensive here.
 every door has a camera.
 every vendor is licensed.


 FUNCTION:
     high-tier fabrication
     regulated extraction contracts
     faction storylines
     "law" quests
     social pressure zone
     reputation as passport

 FACTION: GARRISON
     enforcers, regulators, architects of compliance
     they have resources
     they have structure
     they have territory
     they want order (their order)

 STORY HOOK:
     garrison is running
     on a legacy authorization server
     that no one can replace.

     the admin account is still active.
     but the person it belongs to is dead.

     their credentials are the closest thing
     this world has to a crown.

     several groups are quietly trying
     to impersonate a ghost.



===============================================================================
[DRAINNET]   S H A D O W   D O C K S   /   L O W   T R U S T
===============================================================================


        "everything is available.
         nothing is clean."


 where water and data both go
 when nobody wants to claim them.

 low, wet, crowded with cables,
 vents, and illegal signal repeaters.

 the neon here is dimmer, older, more desperate.
 the people are friendly
 in the way that means they're measuring you.


 FUNCTION:
     black market
     anomaly services
     contraband trades
     rumor economy
     "optional cooking" culture
     (sealed rations, counterfeit nutrients,
      synth meat that may or may not be safe)

 TONE:
     intimate and predatory
     the best deals are the ones
     that never happened

 STORY HOOK:
     drainnet has a door
     that appears only when
     you've been forgotten by the system—
     when your reputation cache desyncs
     and the city stops "seeing" you.

     people call it the leak.

     if you step through,
     you're in a version of the streets
     with warmer colors and simpler sounds.

     not nostalgia.
     older rendering.
     archaeology.



===============================================================================
[NULLZONE]   W I L D E R N E S S
===============================================================================


        "the rules thin out
         because the enforcement layer never loads."


 not nature. not freedom.
 abandonment running at full voltage.

 infrastructure with no off switch.
 pylons sparking in the rain.
 substations humming like beasts in the dark.
 the air tastes metallic.


 FUNCTION:
     pvp enabled (full loot)
     rare extraction nodes
     high-risk salvage
     anomaly events
     reputation forged without witnesses

 MECHANICS:
     level ranges increase heading north
     deeper = better loot, worse odds
     your body drops everything
     others can take it
     there is no customer service

 LEVEL ZONES:
     nullzone edge (lvl 1-20)
     mid nullzone (lvl 20-40)
     deep nullzone (lvl 40+)


 STORY HOOK:
     deep in the nullzone,
     there's a neighborhood
     still lit like a party.

     music plays from somewhere
     with no power source.

     it's not a safe zone,
     but nobody fights there.
     everyone who attacks first
     disconnects.

     people call it the courtesy bug.

     nobody knows if it's a glitch
     or the last remaining piece
     of morality in the code.

===============================================================================


 KERNEL CITY (faction)
     territory: kernel city proper
     values: process, records, interface
     they remember everything
     especially what you wish they'd forget

 GARRISON (faction)
     territory: garrison district
     values: order, compliance, control
     they help you
     but never for free


 neutral zones:
     bootyard (starter protection)
     nullgate (threshold culture)
     drainnet (too corrupt to claim)

 contested:
     nullzone (no faction, no rules)

     bootyard → kernel city → nullgate
         ↑                        ↓
     drainnet ← ← garrison ← ← ← ←

 travel options:
     walk (free, slow, dangerous)
     transit (costs credits, connects hubs)
     displacement (anomaly skill, costs corruption)

 safe zones:
     bootyard (full protection)
     kernel city plaza (enforced)
     garrison core (controlled)

 contested zones:
     drainnet (anything goes, quietly)
     nullgate outskirts (pvp-adjacent)

 wilderness:
     nullzone (full loot pvp)
     the further north, the worse it gets
