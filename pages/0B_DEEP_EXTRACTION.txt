[0x0B] DEEP EXTRACTION   ( M I N I N G )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "they buried it for a reason.
         you're digging for a different one."


 mining is opening things
 that were sealed on purpose.

 beneath the city:
     vaults
     transit bones
     buried infrastructure

 beneath the wilderness:
     mistakes
     experiments
     things best left quiet

 depth increases pressure.
 pressure reveals intent.


 extraction targets:

 SCRAP METAL (shallow)
     common, heavy, essential for fabrication
     found in collapsed structures, buried vehicles
     every maker needs a supplier

 RARE COMPONENTS (mid-depth)
     circuit boards, intact wiring, sealed batteries
     worth more than scrap by weight
     rustborn pay premium for clean components

 SEALED CACHES (deep)
     pre-collapse storage, corporate vaults, military bunkers
     risk increases with depth
     crawlers nest in the dark
     but the loot remembers what quality meant

 CORRUPTION NODES (fracture-adjacent)
     raw instability, anomaly fuel source
     nullsect territory, officially
     but they can't guard every vein


 extraction requires tools.
 tools require fabrication.
 fabrication requires extraction.

 the loop has no exit.
 only deeper.
