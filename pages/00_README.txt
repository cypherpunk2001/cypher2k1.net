        "read what remains.
         trust nothing completely."


 this archive contains fragments.
 none of them are complete.
 all of them are true.

 read out of order.
 nothing breaks.


 what this is:
     a multiplayer survival game
     set in a future that already collapsed
     inspired by runescape classic
     rebuilt for a world that stopped pretending

 what you do:
     scavenge, salvage, fabricate, fight
     build reputation with factions who remember everything
     explore a city that watches
     survive the NULLZONE (the wilderness) that doesn't care

 what you risk:
     your inventory (always)
     your time (always)
     your reputation (permanently)

 what you keep:
     your skills (forever)
     your knowledge (hopefully)
     your grudges (definitely)


 the system does not explain itself.
 this archive is the closest you get.
