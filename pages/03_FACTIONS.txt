[0x03] FACTIONS   ( C L A N S )

        "loyalty is a vulnerability.
         but so is isolation."


 no heroes.
 only incentives.

 join nothing.
 be noticed anyway.


 THE SYNDICATE
     corporate remnants still playing by old rules
     they have resources, structure, territory
     they want order (their order)
     wear their badge: access granted, freedom revoked

 THE RUSTBORN
     scavengers, makers, jury-riggers
     they build from wreckage
     they trade in skills and salvage
     no hierarchy, only reputation

 THE NULLSECT
     anomaly chasers, reality deniers
     they believe the glitches are messages
     dangerous, unstable, occasionally right
     high risk to associate, high reward if they like you

 THE BURNED
     wilderness permanents, player killers, exiles
     no faction loyalty, only survival
     attack on sight in the wastes
     some were once like you


 you don't apply.
 you drift close.
 they notice.
 they remember.

 help them enough: doors open.
 cross them once: doors close forever.

 the system tracks every interaction.
 there is no fresh start.
