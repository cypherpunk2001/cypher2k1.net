[0x0A] IGNITION   ( F I R E M A K I N G )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "light attracts.
         that's the problem."


 fire is not primitive.
 fire is control.

 ignition provides:
     light
     heat
     signal
     temporary power

 lighting something means choosing visibility.

 warmth keeps you alive.
 attention gets you killed.


 ignition uses:

 COOKING FIRES
     turns raw scavenge into safe rations
     essential for health regeneration
     smoke visible, location compromised

 HEAT SOURCES
     survival in cold zones, wilderness nights
     damage over time without warmth
     shared fires build temporary trust

 SIGNAL FLARES
     emergency beacon, extraction request
     calls attention (all kinds)
     faction-specific signals exist

 POWER CELLS
     charged via ignition, spent via use
     fuels lights, tools, energy weapons
     the real currency of the undercity


 higher ignition skill:
     faster fires, less fuel consumed
     cleaner burns (less smoke, less attention)
     ability to charge better cells

 fire in the wilderness is a beacon.
 fire in the undercity is survival.
 fire in the wrong place
 is an invitation.
