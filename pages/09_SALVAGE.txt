[0x09] SALVAGE   ( W O O D C U T T I N G )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "nothing was built to last.
         everything was built to be sold."


 there are no trees.
 there are structures that stopped being maintained.

 salvage is identifying lies:
     load-bearing beams
     synthwood panels
     forgotten scaffolds

 you are not chopping.
 you are reclaiming matter
 from abandoned intent.

 cities rot differently than forests.


 salvage yields:

 SYNTHWOOD
     composite building material, burns clean
     fuel for ignition, material for construction
     abundant in residential ruins

 PLASTIITE
     industrial polymer, flexible, strong
     used in armor padding, insulation, seals
     found in commercial zones, warehouses

 ALLOY FRAMING
     structural metal, lighter than scrap
     high-tier fabrication ingredient
     worth the climb to upper floors

 INTACT GLASS
     rare, fragile, valuable
     optical components, trade goods
     one wrong swing and it's worthless dust


 better tools salvage faster.
 higher skill identifies better cuts.
 the building doesn't care how long you take.

 but the player watching you
 from across the street
 might.
