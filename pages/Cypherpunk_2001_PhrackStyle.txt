        "the system didn't crash.
         it just stopped caring."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0x00] PREFACE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this is not a game about tomorrow.
tomorrow already happened.
it was patched, monetized, deprecated, and abandoned.

what remains is a city that still runs,
a wilderness that no longer should,
and players who refuse to log out.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0x01] THE CITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

neon does not mean alive.
light does not mean safe.

the city watches itself through you.

streets loop.
tunnels repeat.
signage flickers like corrupted scripture.

advertisements whisper:
    BUY
    OBEY
    REMEMBER

everyone belongs to something here.
even if they swear they don't.

especially if they swear they don't.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0x02] THE WILDERNESS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this is not nature.
this is abandonment.

broken infrastructure glowing in the dark,
systems that never shut down because no one was left
to turn them off.

the air hums.
packets drop.
rules thin out.

this is where reputations are written
without witnesses.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0x03] FACTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

no heroes.
no flags.
no clean lines.

only crews.
cells.
ideologues.
survivors.

you don't join them.
you drift.
they notice.
they remember.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0x04] REPUTATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

not a number.
not a bar.
not a grind.

reputation is memory.

doors open because someone remembers.
doors close because someone else never forgot.

the system does not forgive.
it just caches.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0x05] THE FRACTURE (TIME MACHINE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

not a vehicle.
not a reset.
not a save point.

a fracture.

the same streets,
re-rendered in an older language.

simpler colors.
warmer sounds.
myth instead of brutality.

nostalgia is not the goal.
archaeology is.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0x06] LIGHT / DARK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this is not day and night.

this is clarity and distortion.

some truths only appear in the glow.
others only in shadow.

ask yourself:
what changes when you see clearly?
what changes when you don't?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0x07] MULTIPLAYER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you are never alone.
you are never comforted.

others pass through your screen.
few pass through your memory.

connection without safety.
presence without relief.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0x08] CORE LOOP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you survive.
you adapt.
you leave traces.

this is not a power fantasy.
this is a persistence fantasy.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0xFF] FINAL PROMPT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if the future already broke...

what are you still doing here?
