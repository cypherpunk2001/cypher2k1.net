[0x07] COOKING   ( C O O K I N G )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "civilization is heat applied correctly.
         everything else is gambling."


 cooking is not flavor.
 cooking is sanitation.

 heat kills parasites.
 heat neutralizes poison.
 heat turns biomass into rations.

 only cooked matter restores health reliably.

 this is not culture.
 this is survival discipline.

 fire makes it legal to live.


 cooking transforms:

 RAW SCAVENGE → BASIC RATIONS
     removes most contamination
     restores health slowly
     anyone can do this

 BASIC RATIONS → QUALITY MEALS
     better restoration, longer buffs
     requires skill, requires ingredients
     trade value increases

 QUALITY MEALS → SPECIALIZED FOOD
     combat buffs, skill bonuses, resistance effects
     high-level cooking, rare components
     the difference between surviving and winning


 cooking failures:
     undercooked: contamination remains
     burnt: nutrition destroyed
     wrong combination: poison

 higher cooking skill:
     fewer failures, better results
     ability to identify what you're working with
     recipes unlock (discovered, traded, stolen)


 a good cook never starves.
 a good cook never fights alone.

 share food: build trust.
 poison food: end trust permanently.

 the system remembers
 every meal you've served.
