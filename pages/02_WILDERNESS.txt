        "nature didn't reclaim this.
         it was never invited back."


 not nature.
 not freedom.

 abandonment running at full voltage.

 the wilderness is everything outside corporate jurisdiction.
 no laws. no enforcers. no consequences except the ones
 other players bring with them.

 here, anyone can attack anyone.
 here, your inventory is only yours
 until someone stronger disagrees.

 the deeper you go:
     better loot spawns
     harder hostiles
     longer walks back if you die

 your body drops everything.
 others can take it.
 there is no customer service.

 some players live out here permanently.
 they hunt other players.
 they know the routes.
 they see you before you see them.

 the wilderness doesn't kill you.
 the wilderness just stops pretending
 anyone will help.
