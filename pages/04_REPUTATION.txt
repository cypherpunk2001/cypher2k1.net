[0x04] REPUTATION   ( H O N O R )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "forgiveness requires deletion.
         the system doesn't delete."


 reputation is memory with latency.

 the system caches grudges.


 every action writes to the ledger:
     who you killed
     who you helped
     who saw you do it
     who heard about it later

 reputation is not a number.
 reputation is a web.

 high syndicate rep:
     city access, corporate zones, clean gear
     but the rustborn stop talking when you walk in
     and the nullsect won't sell you glyphs

 high rustborn rep:
     best fabrication, fair trades, workshop access
     but syndicate enforcers mark you as salvage
     and corp zones require bribes

 high nullsect rep:
     anomaly training, corruption sources, forbidden knowledge
     but everyone else thinks you're unstable
     and maybe they're right

 negative rep:
     attack on sight
     no trades
     no shelter
     hunted

 reputation decays slowly.
 reputation rebuilds slower.

 the only way to clear your name
 is to become someone else.

 the system remembers that too.
