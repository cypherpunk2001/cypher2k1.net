[0x08] FOOD LOOP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "find it. clean it. repeat.
         this is the entire economy."


 scavenging finds calories.
 cooking makes them safe.

 skip scavenging:
     you starve.

 skip cooking:
     you gamble.

 the world is poisoned just enough
 to punish shortcuts.

 autonomy requires both.


 the loop in practice:

 PHASE 1: LOCATE
     find water, find pools, find sources
     higher scavenging reveals better spots
     contested spots yield better catches
     uncontested spots have reasons

 PHASE 2: HARVEST
     pull biomass, identify what you caught
     contamination varies by source
     rare catches exist (valuable, dangerous, both)

 PHASE 3: PROCESS
     fire required (ignition skill)
     cooking skill determines outcome
     time investment versus quality tradeoff

 PHASE 4: CONSUME
     health restoration
     potential buffs (quality dependent)
     potential debuffs (failure dependent)


 the food loop is not optional.
 the food loop is not exciting.
 the food loop is the foundation
 that everything else stands on.

 players who master this
 never worry about health.
 players who skip this
 become loot for players who didn't.
