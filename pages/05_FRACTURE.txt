[0x05] THE FRACTURE   ( C L A S S I C )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "the past isn't gone.
         it's just running on older hardware."


 same map.
 older language.

 archaeology disguised as nostalgia.


 the fracture is not time travel.
 the fracture is version control.

 somewhere, an older build still runs.
 simpler graphics. warmer palette. different rules.
 the world before the collapse
 cached and forgotten on a server
 no one remembered to shut down.

 entry points exist:
     unstable zones where timelines bleed
     artifacts that remember their origin
     rituals the nullsect guards jealously

 in the fracture:
     different hostiles (older models, simpler patterns)
     different loot (legacy gear, deprecated but functional)
     different reputation (your sins haven't happened yet)

 time passes differently.
 stay too long and you drift.
 drift too far and finding your way back
 becomes the whole game.

 some players prefer the old world.
 some players never come back.

 the fracture doesn't judge.
 the fracture just renders what it remembers.
