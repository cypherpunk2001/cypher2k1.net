[2026.02.04] THE HARD PART IS DONE

 the foundational engineering is complete.
 server architecture. networking. persistence. performance.
 all the stuff that usually kills indie MMO projects.

 built. tested. working at scale.


 WHAT WE BUILT:

     server-authoritative model.
     clients send intent ("move left", "attack").
     server simulates the world.
     compact snapshots stream back over UDP.
     low latency.

     delta compression.
     binary snapshot encoding.
     packet fragmentation.
     rate-limited update loops.

     networking built for real scale.
     not just a tech demo.


 PERSISTENCE:

     player data persists to redis.
     tiered save system.

     critical actions (death, level-up): instant save.
     regular progress: batched every 30 seconds.

     validation and recovery paths.
     corrupted data can't break accounts.


 ZONE ARCHITECTURE:

     world split into zones.
     players only receive data for current zone.
     NPCs only simulate where players actually are.

     this is how we hit 1,000 concurrent players per server.
     the server only does work that matters.


 PERFORMANCE:

     spatial culling grids.
     efficient collision and visibility.

     pooled allocations in hot loops.
     no GC stalls.

     snapshot throttling.
     managed bandwidth.

     stress-tested to 1,000 concurrent.
     profiling and GC scheduling tooling.
     stable frame times under load.

     production-ready.


 THE STACK:

     raylib          // 2D graphics
     common lisp     // SBCL, rapid iteration
     custom UDP      // networking layer
     redis           // persistence

     architecture is modular:
         networking
         movement
         combat
         AI
         rendering
         persistence

     cleanly separated.
     maintainable as the codebase grows.


 WHAT'S NEXT:

     we're past the infrastructure grind.
     the MMO tech is real and proven.

     now it's the fun stuff:
         content
         world design
         gameplay systems

     the engine is ready.
     time to make a game.

 the system remembers what we tell it.
 we are telling it everything.

[PENDING] FUTURE TRANSMISSIONS

 - sprite development
 - gameplay systems
 - world building
 - sound design
 - community input

 this log will update as development continues.
 subscribe to nothing.
 check back when you remember.

 or don't.
 the archive doesn't mind.
