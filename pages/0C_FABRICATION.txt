[0x0C] FABRICATION   ( S M I T H I N G )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        "distance is a luxury.
         weight is a guarantee."


 fabrication is recomposition.

 scrap becomes armor.
 metal becomes proximity violence.

 melee weapons are honest.
 they require commitment.
 they do not negotiate distance.

 when power fails,
 weight still matters.


 fabrication creates:

 WEAPONS
     pipes, blades, bludgeons, improvised and deliberate
     damage scales with material quality
     the best weapons have names and histories

 ARMOR
     plating, padding, salvaged composites
     reduces incoming damage, adds weight
     looking protected makes you a target

 TOOLS
     extraction picks, salvage cutters, ignition kits
     better tools mean faster gathering
     tool quality gates resource access

 COMPONENTS
     parts for advanced crafting
     trade goods with stable value
     the economy runs on fabrication


 the rustborn are the best fabricators.
 their workshops are neutral ground.
 bring materials, pay a fee, receive quality.
 or learn the skill yourself
 and owe nothing.

 at high levels,
 you don't just make gear.
 you make the gear that makes other gear.

 monopolies are possible.
 monopolies are remembered.
 someone will always try to break them.
